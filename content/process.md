## How We Work

We've built our process around one idea: **no surprises.** You should know exactly what's happening, when it's happening, and what it's going to cost before a single nail gets driven.

---

## Step 1: Free Consultation

<div class="info-card">

We come to your property, look at the project, listen to what you want, and give you our honest assessment. Sometimes that means telling you that you need less work than you think. Sometimes it means pointing out something you didn't know about.

Either way, you'll get the truth. There's no charge for this and no obligation.

**What to expect:**
- On-site property assessment
- Discussion of your goals, timeline, and budget
- Honest recommendations — even if it means less work for us

## Step 2: Detailed Estimate

<div class="info-card">

You'll receive a written estimate that breaks everything down — materials, labor, permits, timeline, and total cost. We don't do vague "ballpark" numbers or estimates that magically double once the work starts.

**What you'll get:**
- Itemized cost breakdown
- Material specifications
- Projected timeline with milestones
- Clear payment schedule
- Written scope of work

</div>

## Step 3: Build

<div class="info-card">

Once you approve the estimate, we get to work. We handle permits, schedule the trades, order materials, and keep the job moving. You'll have a direct line to us throughout the entire project.

**What we guarantee:**
- Clean, organized job site — every day
- Professional, experienced crews
- Quality materials installed to manufacturer specs
- Regular progress updates — you'll never have to wonder what's happening
- Respect for your property, your neighbors, and your schedule

</div>

## Step 4: Final Walkthrough

<div class="info-card">

When the work is done, we walk through the project together — every detail, every finish, every inch. If there's anything that doesn't meet your expectations, we address it right there.

**We don't call a job done until you do.**

- Point-by-point inspection with you present
- Any punch list items handled immediately
- Final cleanup of the work area
- Warranty information and maintenance recommendations
