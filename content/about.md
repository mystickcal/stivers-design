## Who We Are

Stivers Design Inc is a fully insured general contracting company based in **Warren, Ohio**. We specialize in residential and light commercial construction, from new builds and demolition to full-scale remodels, additions, concrete work, and everything in between.

We're not a massive corporate outfit with layers of project managers between you and the person doing the work. When you hire Stivers Design, you're working directly with people who care about getting it done right.

<h3>Our Promise</h3>
<p>Honest pricing. Quality craftsmanship. Clear communication. No shortcuts, no excuses, no surprises.</p>

## What We Do

We handle a wide range of residential and commercial projects across Trumbull County and the Mahoning Valley:

- **New Builds** — Ground-up residential and commercial construction
- **Demolition** — Full tear-downs, interior gutting, site clearing
- **Siding & Exteriors** — Vinyl, fiber cement, soffit, fascia, trim
- **Additions & Remodels** — Kitchens, bathrooms, basements, room additions
- **Windows & Doors** — Energy-efficient replacements, proper installation
- **Concrete & Masonry** — Driveways, patios, retaining walls, foundations
- **Project Management** — Complete coordination from permits to final walkthrough

## How We're Different

A lot of contractors will tell you what you want to hear to win the job, then disappear when problems come up. That's not how we operate.

<div class="info-card">

**We answer the phone.** If you call, you'll get a real person — not a voicemail that never gets returned.

**We show up when we say we will.** If there's a delay, you'll hear about it before it happens, not after.

**We stand behind our work.** If something isn't right, we fix it. Period.
