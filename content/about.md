## Who We Are

Stivers Design LLC is a fully insured general contracting company based in **Avon, Ohio**. We specialize in residential and light commercial construction, from new builds and demolition to full-scale remodels and additions.

We're not a massive corporate outfit with layers of project managers between you and the person doing the work. When you hire Stivers Design, you're working directly with people who care about getting it done right.

## How We're Different

A lot of contractors will tell you what you want to hear to win the job, then disappear when problems come up. That's not how we operate.

<div class="info-card">

**We answer the phone.** If you call, you'll get a real person — not a voicemail that never gets returned.

**We show up when we say we will.** If there's a delay, you'll hear about it before it happens, not after.

**We stand behind our work.** If something isn't right, we fix it. Period.

## Service Area

We serve homeowners and businesses throughout **Greater Cleveland** and **Northeast Ohio**, including Avon, Avon Lake, Westlake, Rocky River, North Ridgeville, Elyria, Lorain, Lakewood, North Olmsted, Strongsville, Medina, and surrounding communities.
